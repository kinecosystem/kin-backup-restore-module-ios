This module is an optional way to back up and/or restore your account. The module wraps the iOS Kin SDK import and export functionalities with a UI that includes two operations - backup and restore. The UI uses a password to create a QR code, which is then used to back up an account and restore it.

It is implemented as an addition to the Kin SDK framework that can be incorporated into your project. It's assumed that whoever needs to use this module is already familiar with the Kin SDK framework. [Read more.](https://kinecosystem.github.io/kin-website-docs/docs/documentation/backup-restore-ios)
